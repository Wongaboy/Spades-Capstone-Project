  dialogueTexts:
  - "You seem quite lost, have your memories not begun to return? How curious\u2026"
  - "That is uncommon, but not unheard of for souls who led lives such as yours.
    It must have been a long journey through purgatory\u2026"
  - "I shall help you to recollect\u2026"
  - Survival was always your greatest struggle. In life, you faced death at every
    turn. I have been waiting for the moment that it finally caught up to you.
  - "I do not wish to tell you everything at once. It would be overwhelming\u2026
    and much less fun for me. How about this:\r\n"
  - You sit and play a game of Spades with me, and I remind you of your past. Now,
    do you know the rules?
