  dialogueTexts:
  - 'You have sent me many souls to guide.

'
  - "The Space Between is treacherous and impossible for the uninitiated to navigate\r.\n"
  - As a reward for this sacred duty, I have been guaranteed admission to Eternal
    Peace.
  - Before I can pass on, however, I must choose a successor.
  - 'A soul with much to lose, but worthy of redemption.

'
  - 'One such as yourself.

'
  - You faced death at every turn of your life... famine, illness, murder, all manner
    of suffering.
  - You truly understand death.
  - We are afforded certain freedoms in the choosing process, and so I have elected
    to play a favorite game of mine.
  - If you can best me, the job is yours. If not, maybe eternal peace was never in
    the cards for you.
  - "It is quite a responsibility, you must understand. I cannot afford to go easy
    on you\r.\n"
