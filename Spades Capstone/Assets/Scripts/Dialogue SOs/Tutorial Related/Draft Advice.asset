  dialogueTexts:
  - To begin, each of us will draft a hand of 13 cards.
  - To keep a card, move it toward yourself. To discard it, move it away.
  - When you discard a card, you are forced to keep the top card of the deck.
  - Higher cards are more valuable. Ace is the highest. Spades are the best, all
    others are equal.
