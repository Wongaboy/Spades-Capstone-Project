  dialogueTexts:
  - We take turns playing from our hands. Move your chosen card to the table to be
    played. One player leads, the other follows.
  - You must follow suit. Once out of the suit, then any card can be played.
  - "You cannot lead a spade until spades have been \u201Cbroken\u201D, or played
    off suit."
  - 'The highest card wins the trick, unless a Spade is played. Spades trumps all.

'
  - Organize the cards in your hand however you would like.
