  dialogueTexts:
  - We take turns playing from our hands. Move your chosen card to the table to be
    played. One player leads, the other follows.
  - You must follow suit if able. If unable to follow suit, you may play any card
    from your hand off suit.
  - You cannot lead a spade until spades have been broken, or played off suit.
  - Cards you are allowed to play will glow green. Cards you are not will glow red.
  - 'The highest card of the led suit wins, unless a Spade is played off suit. Spades
    trumps all.

'
  - Organize the cards in your hand however you would like.
