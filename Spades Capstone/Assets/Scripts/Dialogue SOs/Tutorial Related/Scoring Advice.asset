  - This board will keep track of the score.
  - If you reach the number of tricks bid, you will earn ten points for each trick
    you bid.
  - Excess tricks will become bags. Upon reaching ten bags you will lose one hundred
    points. Cowardly play is not rewarded.
  - The first to three hundred will be the victor. May the best player win.
